# Diep Showdown

Diep Showdown is a project aimed to replicate [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), but utilize [Diep.io](https://diep.io) mechanics rather than Pokemon mechanics.

## What is Diep.io?
Diep.io is a 2D realtime game where you try getting high scores by farming or killing other players, while keeping yourself alive. Players make it more difficult as you progress.

## Credits
Thank you to **Aspect** and **Bismuth** for previously providing me with a tank renderer which I was able to make tank sources out of!
Currently using an SVG of every tank.

## To-do list:
- [x] Create a WebSocket server and a database system.
- [x] Implement a login system (just registration with a desired username and password).
- [x] UI for creating an account. 
- [ ] UI for teambuilding.
    - [x] Create menu of all current teams.
    - [x] Create menu for tanks.
    - [x] Create info for tank (ability, movepool, etc)
    - [x] Save teams. 
- [ ] UI for battling.
- [ ] Creating sprites, movesets, abilities, etc. for tanks.
- [ ] Create a battle system.

This list will be expanded as time continues.

**PROGRESS IS VARIABLE AND MAY CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT.**
