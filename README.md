# Diep Showdown

Diep Showdown is a project aimed to replicate [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), but utilize [Diep.io](https://diep.io) mechanics rather than Pokemon mechanics.

## What is Diep.io?
Diep.io is a 2D realtime game where you try getting high scores by farming or killing other players, while keeping yourself alive. Players make it more difficult as you progress.

## What features are going to be implemented?
WIP.

## To-do list:
- [x] Create a WebSocket server and a database system.
- [x] Implement a login system (just registration with a desired username and password).
- [ ] UI for creating an account.
- [ ] UI for battling/teambuilding.
- [ ] Creating sprites, movesets, abilities, etc. for tanks.
- [ ] Create a battle system.

This list will be expanded as time continues.

**PROGRESS IS VARIABLE AND MAY CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT.**
